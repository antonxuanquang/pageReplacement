# BankerAlgorithm

The purpose of this programming project is to explore a resource allocation algorithm. This can be achieved by implementing the banker's algorithm as described in our textbook and discussed in class

Compile
```
go build bankerAlgorithm
```

Run: ```./bankerAlgorithm <file>```

Example:
```
./bankerAlgorithm sample.txt
```
